# Book reader

In this reposytory is program 'book_reader.py' - it is text to speech with [silero models](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models).

In my opinion the best voice in russian is 'xenia'. So in my project I use it. 

## Necessary library

```bash
pip3 install silero
pip3 install torch
pip3 install torchaudio
pip3 install tqdm
pip3 install sounddevice
```
If that is not enough, you can see my [list of library]() and check your list with command
```bash
pip3 list
```
